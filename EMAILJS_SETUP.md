## Free Tier Limits

EmailJS free tier includes:

- 200 emails per month
- 2 email templates
- 1 email service
- Perfect for a portfolio contact form!

## Troubleshooting

- **Email not sending?** Check your browser console for errors
- **Invalid credentials?** Double-check your Service ID, Template ID, and Public Key
- **Email not arriving?** Check your spam folder
- **Still having issues?** Visit [EmailJS Documentation](https://www.emailjs.com/docs/)

## Security Note

The credentials in `contactme.js` are safe to expose in your frontend code. EmailJS designed their system to work this way. The Public Key is meant to be public!
